 1. Introduction
The main objective of this project is to develop a new Web Based Dormitory Management System which solves the problems in the TEDU dorms. This is achieved by designing a web-based.
2. Current system (if any)
The current system of the TED dormitory continues in the old way, that is, with papers and documents. There is no online system. Only announcements can be followed from social media accounts.
3. Proposed system
The system we propose is precisely to perceive and solve problems that occur piece by piece as a whole. We have taken the main problems of the dormitory administration and the students staying in the dormitory by hand in the main headings. If the complexity of the problem increases, we know that we need to move towards a common solution as a system and server. However, the main point we are focusing on at this stage is to be able to produce an effective solution.
We will use our own computers hardware-wise. As a software, our goal is to Decode backend and frontend technologies together. For this we need basic programming languages such as Java, Javascript. However, in terms of the details and availability of our project, we will also need libraries in our project.
The customer or user will not be aware of the technical evaluations we have made. However, we want to use a structure where the end user has direct access to our product. That is why we want to implement our testing stages while developing our current system.
